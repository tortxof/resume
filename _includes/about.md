I am a motivated, self-taught developer looking for an opportunity to work on
either front-end or back-end web technologies. I've been building websites with
HTML and CSS since the late '90s. Since 2012 I have been learning Python, and I
very much enjoy using this language. My first exploration into back-end web
programming was with the CherryPy framework. Since then I have used Flask and
Django. In 2015 and early 2016 I spent a lot of time learning about front-end
programming in JavaScript. I started using Git in 2012, and I believe this is an
essential tool for developers. After starting FreeCodeCamp's Front End
Development Certification, I began attending weekly meetups for FreeCodeCamp in
Greenville, SC. At these meetups I have collaborated on coding challenges with
fellow FCC students. My experience with Linux server administration goes back to
the mid 2000s. I have experience deploying LAMP stack software such as phpBB and
Wordpress. More recently, I've employed Docker for deployment of my own Python
back-end projects. I've been employed for more than 13 years as a computer
technician repairing desktop and laptop computers.
