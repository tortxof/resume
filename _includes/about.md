I am a motivated, self-taught developer looking for an opportunity to work on
either front-end or back-end web technologies. I've been building websites with
HTML and CSS since the late '90s. Since 2012 I have been learning Python, and I
very much enjoy using this language. My first exploration into back-end web
programming was with the CherryPy framework. Since then I have used Flask and
Django. In 2015 and early 2016 I spent a lot of time learning about front-end
programming in JavaScript. I started using Git in 2012, and I believe this is an
essential tool for developers. After starting freeCodeCamp's Front End
Development Certification, I began attending weekly meet-ups for freeCodeCamp in
Greenville, SC. At these meet-ups I have collaborated on coding challenges with
fellow FCC students. I completed freeCodeCamp's Front End Development
Certification in August 2016. I currently host and mentor at the weekly
freeCodeCamp meet-ups in Greenville. Since the fall of 2017, I have been a
mentor for the [SC Codes](https://sccodes.org/) program. My experience with
Linux server administration goes back to the mid 2000s. I have experience
deploying LAMP stack software such as phpBB and Wordpress. I've employed Docker
for deployment of my own Python back-end projects. Most recently I've migrated
all of my personal projects to AWS Lambda using [Zappa](https://www.zappa.io/).
I've been employed for more than 13 years as a computer technician repairing
Windows desktop and laptop computers.
